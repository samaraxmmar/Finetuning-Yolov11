This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning the YOLOv11 object detection model to detect equipment in a custom dataset.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to adapt a state-of-the-art object detection model, YOLOv11, to recognize specific pieces of equipment within an image dataset. The provided notebook guides you through the process of:

* Setting up the necessary environment and dependencies.
* Loading and preprocessing your custom equipment detection dataset.
* Configuring and fine-tuning the YOLOv11 model using your data.
* Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned model.
* Optionally, running inference on new images to detect equipment.

## Key Features

* **YOLOv11 Implementation:** Utilizes the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection framework.
* **Custom Dataset Support:** Designed to work with your own dataset of equipment images and annotations.
* **Clear and Concise Notebook:** The Jupyter Notebook is well-commented and organized for easy understanding and modification.
* **Fine-Tuning Methodology:** Focuses on transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained weights to achieve good performance with a potentially smaller custom dataset.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes steps to evaluate the trained model using relevant object detection metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x**
* **PyTorch** (installation instructions can be found on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/))
* **CUDA** (if you plan to train on a GPU for faster performance)
* **Other necessary libraries** as specified in the `requirements.txt` file (you can generate this from your environment using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
